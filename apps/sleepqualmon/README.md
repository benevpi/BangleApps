#Sleep Quality Monitor

Used the sleep quality calculation in Sleep Phase Alarm, but records the number of seconds 'sleep' per 100 seconds and record this number to a CSV file. 

Don't yet do anything useful with this data, but I'll have a poke around it once it's recorded for a few nights and see what's useful

##TODO
- see if the data's useful / what I can do with it
- does it make sense to group differently to 100 second intervals?
- can I create an auto-uploader for adafruitIO / google sheets? May be some funky webbluetooth thing I can do to stream straight to a google sheet?
- Can I create a graph in the app? see the pedometer thing for an example
- looks like there may be a bug with the watch face and a widget in the bottom left?
- see what battery life is like
